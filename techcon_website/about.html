        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2017 by a collective of tech professionals and educators,
          TECHCON began as a small meetup in a San Francisco co-working space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was simple: create a collaborative hub for those building the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, TECHCON has evolved into one of the most anticipated
          global conferences in the tech calendar â€” drawing over 10,000
          attendees from more than 50 countries annually.
